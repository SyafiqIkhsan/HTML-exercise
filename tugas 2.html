<b>Recently</b>, the high-end EV world has become a Nurburgring arms race with Porsche and Tesla 
vying for the best lap at the famed circuit. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/08/26/porsche-taycan-nurburgring-record/">The Taycan</a> set a record and <span style="color: red"><b>Tesla</b></span> <u>CEO</u> Elon Musk 
decided that the Model S would best it. From early reports, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/18/intrigue-at-the-nurburgring-as-tesla-unofficially-beats-porsche/">Fremont company did just 
  that</a> with a heavily modified vehicle. 
<br> 
<br>
Ahead of the Tesla run, I sat down with Porsche's North America <u>CEO</u>, Klaus Zellmer, to talk 
rivalries, where the <em>Taycan</em> sits in the EV world and the surprising demographics it's gathered 
from its subscription service. 
<br>
<br>
"<em>Many people are talking about competition and all that. We love competition. We come from 
the racetrack. The Nurburgring; we love that environment. But first and foremost, we want to 
present an alternative, carrying the badge Porsche and the brand promise -- to everything that 
is electric out there right now.</em>" Zellmer said.
