  The scariest thing about <a href="http://www.wohgame.com/"><em>World of Horror</em></a> might be the fact that it's being lovingly crafted 
by a part-time dentist. <font style="color: red;"><b>Pawel Kozminski</b></font> is the sole creator of <em>World of Horror</em>, and he 
also practices dentistry in Poland, splitting his time between poking at people's molars 
and placing pixels in the perfect spots using MS Paint. Yes, <em>that</em> Paint.
<br>
<br>
<em>World of Horror</em> is borne of strange circumstances, which might explain why the game 
itself is so unsettling. It plays out in five short stories set in a seaside village in 1980s 
Japan, whose residents are falling into mass madness while eldritch monsters rise from 
the seas. Eerie chiptune music plays throughout the game, frantic and propelling. 
People have gone missing, festering demons are walking the streets, and sushi chefs 
are serving <em>omakase</em> with human eyeballs on the platter. Fight scenes are turn-based, 
forcing you to stare down your fears and face slaughter one move at a time.
