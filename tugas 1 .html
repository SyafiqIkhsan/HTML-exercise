            Apple's iPhone 5c isn't the low-cost phone you've been waiting for 
        </h3>

 <b>The iPhone 5c,</b> simply put, is for those who've grown numb to Apple's largely evolutionary 
    takes on its primary iPhone range. It'll attract a younger audience that cares less about finely 
    beveled edges and more about playing <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/09/10/iphone-5s-and-5c-cases/"><em>Connect 4</em> on their iPhone case</a>. It'll cater to the same 
    <span style="color: green;"><em>crowd that has looked</em></span> longingly towards the $599 (again, off-contract) <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/08/05/motorola-moto-x-review/">Moto X</a> -- a phone for the 
    mainstream, and a phone that's as colorful as one's soul. In a way, this is the anti-Moto X. From a 
    price, spec and feature perspective, it's a match that's too close to call. The iPhone 5c's camera 
    <span style="color: red;">has</span> an edge on the <span style="color: red;"><strong>Moto X</strong></span>, but the X's Active Display is a boon for notifications. As these things 
    tend to go, a lot of it boils down to ecosystem preference. The iPhone 5c is being built for the 
    same audience as the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/09/07/ipod-nano-review-2010/">flashy iPod nano</a>, and moreover, Apple built it for those on Wall Street
    who feel that it simply must attract new markets to stay atop its game.
    <hr style="border: 1px solid #000; width: 100%; margin: 20px auto;">
    Apple never showed intentions of racing the <b><u>Nexus 7</u></b> to the bottom in the tablet game, and the 
    <em><b>iPhone 5c</b></em> is proof that it won't do that in the phone arena, either.
